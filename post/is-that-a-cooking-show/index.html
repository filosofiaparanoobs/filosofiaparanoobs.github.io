      <article class="post-content">
      <p>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y&rsquo;all are in a 12-piece bucket o&rsquo; trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin&rsquo; up that ol&rsquo; mess you caused.</p>
<p>Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Hi, I&rsquo;m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9. 95 a minute. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p>
<h2 id="do-a-flip">Do a flip!</h2>
<p>She also liked to shut up! Belligerent and numerous. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Is that a cooking show? I found what I need. And it&rsquo;s not friends, it&rsquo;s things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</li>
<li>Oh, I think we should just stay friends.</li>
<li>Can we have Bender Burgers again?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hello-morbo-hows-the-family">Hello Morbo, how&rsquo;s the family?</h2>
<p>Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Who am I making this out to? It&rsquo;s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by &ldquo;devil&rdquo;, I mean Robot Devil. And by &ldquo;metaphorically&rdquo;, I mean get your coat.</p>
<ul>
<li>My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book &lsquo;Earth in the Balance&rsquo;&rsquo;, and the much more popular &lsquo;&lsquo;Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth&rsquo;, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</li>
<li>Ummm…to eBay?</li>
<li>One hundred dollars.
Stop it, stop it. It&rsquo;s fine. I will &lsquo;destroy&rsquo; you! Alright, let&rsquo;s mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Calculon is gonna kill us and it&rsquo;s all everybody else&rsquo;s fault!</li>
</ul>
<p>There, now he&rsquo;s trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! And when we woke up, we had these bodies. When will that be? Fatal. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>
<p>Morbo can&rsquo;t understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that&rsquo;s shaped like a man wearing a hat. Bender?! You stole the atom. What are their names? Yeah, and if you were the pope they&rsquo;d be all, &ldquo;Straighten your pope hat.&rdquo; And &ldquo;Put on your good vestments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t &rsquo;need&rsquo; to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Shut up and take my money! Hey, whatcha watching? You mean while I&rsquo;m sleeping in it? No, she&rsquo;ll probably make me do it. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won&rsquo;t be sure you&rsquo;ve done anything at all.</p>
<p>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. It must be wonderful. Shut up and take my money! Hey, tell me something. You&rsquo;ve got all this money. How come you always dress like you&rsquo;re doing your laundry?</p>
<p>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn&rsquo;t you just get me the death penalty? With gusto. Our love isn&rsquo;t any different from yours, except it&rsquo;s hotter, because I&rsquo;m involved. Oh Leela! You&rsquo;re the only person I could turn to; you&rsquo;re the only person who ever loved me.</p>
<p>Bender, this is Fry&rsquo;s decision… and he made it wrong. So it&rsquo;s time for us to interfere in his life. I was all of history&rsquo;s great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!</p>
<p>No! The cat shelter&rsquo;s on to me. Shinier than yours, meatbag. Morbo can&rsquo;t understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that&rsquo;s shaped like a man wearing a hat. We&rsquo;re also Santa Claus!</p>
<p>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Good man. Nixon&rsquo;s pro-war and pro-family. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as &ldquo;the brig&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ve killed me! Oh, you&rsquo;ve killed me!</p>
<p>Fry, you can&rsquo;t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And why did &lsquo;I&rsquo; have to take a cab? You know, I was God once. Hello Morbo, how&rsquo;s the family? Tell her she looks thin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Okay, I like a challenge. So, how &lsquo;bout them Knicks? Ummm…to eBay?</p>
